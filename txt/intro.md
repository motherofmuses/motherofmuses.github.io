In acient Greek mythology the nine Muses are the inspirational goddesses of literature, science, and the arts. 
Each Muse personifies a field of artistic endeavor, for example Calliope literature, Euterpe music and Clio sculpture.
Like most mythological creatures they are embedded in the ancient family tree of gods and titans.
The nine Muses share the same father: Zeus himself. Their mother is the daughter of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth): Mnemosyne.
Her name is derived from the Greek word mnēmē, which means remembrance, memory. Memory is the Mother of Muses.
