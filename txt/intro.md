In acient Greek mythology the nine Muses are the inspirational goddesses of literature, science, and the arts. Each Muse personifies a field of artistic endeavor, for example Calliope literature, Euterpe music and Clio sculpture. Like most mythological creatures they are embedded in the ancient family tree of gods and titans. The nine Muses share the same father: Zeus himself; their mother is the daughter of Sky (Uranus) and Earth (Gaia): Mnemosyne. Her name is derived from the Greek word mnēmē, which means remembrance, memory. Memory is the Mother of Muses.

“Mnemosyne, one must admit, has shown herself to be a very careless girl”, wrote the great Russian writer Nabokov in his Autobiography Speak, Memory. Indeed, and if this weren't the case, this blog would not exist. The aim of this blog is to prepare one possible approach for lifelong learning in the digital age. First, we will take a look at cognitive and experimental psychology and then we will try to directly apply what we have learned into the flashcard program Anki. This blog is intended for the lifelong learner and for the advanced Anki user, who is looking for new ideas. It is not intended for language learning, exam preperation nor as a means to make learning necessarily easier. However, some of the basics we will cover might be useful for anybody. The main idea behind this "framework" is to make knowledge meaningful and learning/remembering an active experience. As always, there are multiple approaches to everything, you take the approach you want. Have fun. 




Repetition is key.
