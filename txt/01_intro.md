In acient Greek mythology the Nine Muses are the inspirational goddesses of literature, science, and the arts. As mythological creatures they are part of the ancient family tree of Gods and Titans. The Muses share the same father, Zeus himself, and their mother is the daughter of Sky and Earth: Mnemosyne. Her name is derived from the Greek word *mnēmē*, which means remembrance, memory. Thus Memory is the mother of the Muses.

“Mnemosyne, one must admit, has shown herself to be a very careless girl”, the Russian author Nabokov wrote in his autobiography. Indeed, and if this weren't the case, this blog would not exist. 

The aim of this blog is to prepare one possible approach for lifelong learning in the digital age. It is an attempt to bring closer theoretical findings from cognitive psychology with the usage of the flashcard program Anki.
This blog is intended for the lifelong learner and advanced Anki user. It is not intended for language learning, exam preperation nor as a means to make learning necessarily easier. However, some of the basics we cover may be useful for any learner. The main idea behind this "framework" is to make knowledge meaningful and learning / remembering an active experience. As always, there are multiple approaches to everything - you take the approach you want. Have fun.
