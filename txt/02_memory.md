Plato coined the metaphor of the human memory as a wax tablet. It has been an influential metaphor and to this day similar metaphors are common: memory as a library, house or computer storage. Behind them, there are three central assumption: a) memories are stored at a specific location in the brain, b) memories stay in the background passivly until they get retrieved and c) the retrival of memories is a transfer from information in one store (long-term memory) to another (short-term or working memory). As we will see, these three assumptions are problematic and have to be revised. Memory is not a passiv storage of information, it is a dynamic process.

The current paradigm for memory research is the so called information processing paradigm. This paradigm asserts that humans don't react directly to a stimulus, rather their reactions are determined by mental representations of the stimulus within a frame of reference. Cognition is also a form of information processing: 
1. Learning is the encoding of new information or the modification of stored information,
2. Memory is the storage of information, and
3. Recall is the retrieval of stored information.

This distinction is essential and we will refer back to this later.

The most popular way to classify the human memory in terms of durability is the multi-store model by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968). It states that memory consists of three different processes: a sensoric register, a short-term store or working memory, and a long-term store.
