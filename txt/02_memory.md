Plato coined the metaphor of human memory as a wax tablet. It has been an influential metaphor and to this day similar metaphors are common: memory as a library, computer storage or house (respectively a room in a house, if you like Freud). Behind these methaphors there are three central assumption: 1) memories are stored at a specific location in the brain, 2) memories exist in the background passivly until they get retireved, 3) the retrival of memories is a process from one storage (long-term memory) to another (short-term or working memory). As we will see, these three assumptions are problematic and have to be revised. Memory is not a passiv storage of information, it is a dynamic (re-)contrsuction process.
